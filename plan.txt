1. Create 4 CIM drive train program

  - The current test bed drive train uses 2 CIMs to drive 6 wheels.
  - The desired drive train will use 4 CIMS, all driven independently.
  - Wrap control of the drive train motors around user-friendly functions (turnLeft(),
    turnRight(), driveForward(), driveBack().)
  - The idea is that high-level code does not need to know which motors turn on and off.  That way,
    if the ports change, we only have to make the change in ONE place: the user-friendly functions.

2. Encoders

  - We will be putting an encoder on each wheel.
  - Write a function that uses the encoder input to determine how far a given wheel has moved.
  - Write a function to tell if a given wheel is not making complete contact with the ground.

3. Front-wheel drive (FWD) vs. rear-wheel drive (RWD):

  - One of two ideas for climbing ramps:
    1. Switch between FWD and RWD with a single switch.  Drivers use the switch as needed to climb ramps.
        2. Use the encoder functions.  Automatically set the flag to switch to RWD (how?) if front wheels are spinning too much

4. Orient robot automatically using two light sensors below the front of the robot

  - Green lines right before tower shooting area; this could be used to make sure the bot is parallel

5. Reflector shooter

  - Reflective tape on the top of the board
  - Use camera to orient shooter.

6. Virtual 2D map of field

  - Might prove challenging.
