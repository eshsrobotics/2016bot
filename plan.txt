Programming plan (in priority order)
1. Create 4 CIM drive train program

  - current drive train is 2 CIMs
  - All 4 CIMS driven independently
  - wrap control around user friendly functions (turnLeft(), turnRight(), driveForward(), driveBack())
  - The idea is that high-level code does not need to know which motors turn on and off.
  
2. Encoders

  -encoder on each wheel, tell how far wheels turn, wheels independently spinning
